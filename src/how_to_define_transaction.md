# How to define transaction

* You can define transaction boundaries either explicitly or implicitly.
* You define the beginning of a transaction explicitly with a *START TRANSACTION* statement. 
* You define the end of a transaction explicitly with a *COMMIT* statement if you want to commit it and with a *ROLLBACK* statement if you want to undo its changes.
